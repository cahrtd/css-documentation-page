# Technical Documentation Page

A mock documentation site built with HTML and CSS, focused on layout and content structure.

## Features
- Navigation sidebar
- Scrollable content sections
- Code blocks with basic styling

## Notes
This was a practice project with some required criteria and limited creative freedom.  
Some design elements are unfinished or messy, but the core structure is functional. 

The written content in this project was generated using ChatGPT, as I chose to focus more on practicing and improving my coding skills.
